# Programming Student

## Overview

I have been a programming student since 2022, currently enrolled in the "Map of Programming" course with a strong focus on the Back-end development track. This track consists of four modules that cover various essential topics in the world of Back-end development. Additionally, I am currently working in the field of IT analysis and support.

## Course Modules

### Module 1: SQL and Database

- This module covers SQL (Structured Query Language) and various aspects of working with databases.
- Topics include data modeling, database design, querying, and optimization.

### Module 2: API with MongoDB, Express, and Mongoose

- In this module, we dive into building APIs using MongoDB as the database, Express.js as the web application framework, and Mongoose as the ODM (Object Data Modeling) library.
- Learn how to create RESTful APIs, handle CRUD operations, and manage data with MongoDB.

### Module 3: Node.js, Sequelize, and Postgres

- Node.js is the focus of this module, exploring how to build server-side applications using JavaScript.
- Additionally, we delve into Sequelize, an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library, and Postgres, a popular relational database management system.

### Module 4: Git and GitHub

- This module covers version control and collaboration using Git and GitHub.
- Learn how to track changes in your codebase, collaborate with others, and manage your projects effectively.

## Current Role: IT Analysis and Support
